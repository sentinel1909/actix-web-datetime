# HTMX: A Demonstration

This simple site serves up a web page the displays the current day and time. The date and time are grabbed once on page load. If you hit the refresh button of your browser, the values will update.

Eventually, I hope to make this site interactive so that you can hit a button and update the clock. I will eventually do this using [htmx](https://htmx.org).
